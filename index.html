                    <p><i>A gritty short drama.</i></p>
                    <p>My masters degree culminated in a final negotiated project, as part of which I created a short drama. In this project I explored the use of found sounds, meaning sounds not typically associated with music, using which I created a soundtrack for the film. <i>All Will Be Well</i> explored the theme of drugs, death, and youth, all of which I wished to explore in the soundtrack.</p>

                  <h5>Twists and Turns</h5>
                  <p><i><em>Twists and Turns</em> is a road safety video campaign encouraging pedestrians to be more vigilant when crossing the roads. The campaign is targeted at all age groups, with a particular focus on the young adults.</i></p>
                  <p><i>Twists and Turns</i> fused the elegance of ballet and urban complexity of the modern city, both of which served as inspiration for the soundtrack. I focused on piano and traditional orchestral elements and combined these with electronic drums and percussion to reflect the imagery and support the pace of the visuals.</p>
                  <p><i>"Very talented and professional, he composed a piece that truly elevated the visuals, constantly showing genuine interest in exploring the creative process of videomaking and being always open to suggestions. I highly recommend Alex as a music composer and I look forward to working together again."</i> - Rino Pucci, director of <em>Twists and Turns</em></p>

                  <h4>Nursery Crimes</h4>
                  <p><i>A mixed-media dark comedy and horror play.</i></p>
                  <p><em>Nursery Crimes</em> had a satirical tone, and used nursery rhymes as the primary stimulus. I created a soundtrack for both live and pre-recorded scenes of the play, with the aim of emphasizing fear and comedy. I also added further layers the nursery rhymes in order to accentuate the tension they created.</p>
                  <p><i>"Working with Alex was a great pleasure, he was highly communicative and had a really clear vision for how he saw the project’s music. Alex was also very good at taking on our feedback and altering the music accordingly; aligning it more in tone and style with the piece."</i> - James Ormrod, director of <em>Nursery Crimes</em></p>

                  <p>Dealing with real stories, and filled with emotional content, the brief asked for the music to be uplifting in order to promote hope. I composed four tracks, each of which suported a different section of the documentary. I also partially edited the voice audio of the project.</p>

                    <p>The brief asked for the music to fill in the gaps between the monolue, work alongside the existing sound design, and provide a dramatic impact during key moments. I decided to create an ambient soundscape, which expressed high altitude and vast space, which grew larger as the video progressed.<p>

                  <p>I created an indie-inspired soundtrack that highlighted youth and adventure, and supported the short film in shedding a creative light on the experiences of young gay adults. Since its release in 2019, <em>Blue Boy</em> has reached over 340,000 views on YouTube.</p>
                  <p><i>"Working with Alex was one of the greatest collaborative relationships I’ve had, he knew exactly the kind of sound I wanted and managed to achieve something that sounded so incredibly perfect for the project that I still can’t believe he made it! Highly recommend."</i> - Ben Massey, director of <em>Blue Boy</em></p>
